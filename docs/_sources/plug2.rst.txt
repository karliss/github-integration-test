Plugins2
========

Cutter supports writing plugins in both C++ and Python.
If you are unsure of which language to choose, starting with Python is strongly suggested as
it provides a faster and simpler workflow.

If you plan to implement support for a new file format or architecture, Cutter plugins are not the correct approach.
Instead, you will want to implement a radare2 plugin, which is documented `here <https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/plugins/intro.html>`_.
